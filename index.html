                    Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schooler—until his family is attacked 
                    by a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that seeks to devour human souls. It is then 
                    that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who gets injured while protecting 
                    Ichigo's family from the assailant. To save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's 
                    offer of taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result. However, as 
                    Rukia is unable to regain her powers, Ichigo is given the daunting task of hunting 
                    down the Hollows that plague their town. However, he is not alone in his fight, as 
                    he is later joined by his friends—classmates Orihime Inoue, Yasutora Sado, and 
                    Uryuu Ishida—who each have their own unique abilities. As Ichigo and his comrades 
                    get used to their new duties and support each other on and off the battlefield, the 
                    young Soul Reaper soon learns that the Hollows are not the only real threat to the 
                    human world.
